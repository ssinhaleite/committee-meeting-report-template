# Committee Meeting Report Template

Template to write the commitee meeting report - with the biblioncs submodules for bibliography from the NCS group

After download this template, you have to initialize the biblio project as a submodule of this project.
To do so, download the script init_papers.sh from https://code.ini.uzh.ch/ncs/maintenance/raw/master/init_papers.sh
and run it in this project's working directory.
This will also copy the ncs_papers.gitignore file from biblio to become the .gitignore file in your project.
